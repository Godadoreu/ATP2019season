    "### 1.1 Definition\n",
    "The ATP Tour is a worldwide top-tier tennis tour for men organized by the Association of Tennis Professionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 History\n",
    "It was formed in September 1972 by Donald Dell, Jack Kramer, and Cliff Drysdale to protect the interests of professional tennis players, and Drysdale became the first President. Since 1990, the association has organized the ATP Tour, the worldwide tennis tour for men and linked the title of the tour with the organization's name. It is the governing body of men's professional tennis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Tournament types \n",
    "The ATP Tour comprises ATP Masters 1000, ATP 500, and ATP 250 tournaments. Grand Slam tournaments do not fall under the auspices of the ATP, but are overseen by the ITF (International Tennis Federation) instead. So, we can see the detailed information from the image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ranking1.png\" width=\"900\">\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for ATP Masters 1000, the player who win the tournament can acquire 1000 ranking points, for ATP 500, the winner can acquire 500 ranking points and for ATP 250, they can acquire 250 ranking points. The highest ranking points are given for the Grand Slam winners, which will give 2000 ranking points. Players and doubles teams with the most ranking points (collected during the calendar year) play in the season-ending ATP Finals, which can give 1100 to 1500 ranking points for the winner. Moreover, the bigger the level of tournament, the bigger total prize money will be given for the player. From the image, we can see that the winner of ATP Finals will get a total of 4.450.000 USD.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 ATP Ranking \n",
    "The ATP Ranking is used for determining qualification for entry and seeding in all tournaments for both singles and doubles. Within the ATP Rankings period consisting of the past year, points are accumulated, with the exception of those for the ATP Finals, whose points are dropped following the last ATP event of the year. \n",
    "\n",
    "                                            Points are awarded as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"distribution.png\" width=\"900\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The description of the columns from the image:\n",
    " 1. R128- Reached round of last 128\n",
    " 2. R64- Reached round of last 64\n",
    " 3. R32- Reached round of last 32\n",
    " 4. R16 - Reached round of last 16\n",
    " 5. QF - Quarterfinalist\n",
    " 6. SF - Semifinalist\n",
    " 7. F- final\n",
    " 8. W - winner\n",
    "\n",
    "As an illustration, if the player win the tournament, the player will get all the points, like if he won the Grand Slam, 2000 ranking points will be given to him, while the player who lose at the final will get only slightly more than the half of that points (1200 points). \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the level of tournament, the number of players is varying. Ranking points are awarded according to the stage of tournament reached, and the prestige of the tournament, where the four Grand Slams awarding the most points. The rankings are updated every Monday, and points are dropped 52 weeks after being awarded.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For a better result within the same tour type to be transposed one has to wait for the expiry of the first worse result from previous year. In order to get more points, the player should go to the further stage of the tournament, while if player lose at the earlier stage than previous year, the result of reached stage will be saved in rankings. So, the players should defend their ranking points or get more points each year on purpose to be higher in ranking. It only expires at the drop date of that tournament and only if the player reached a worse result or has not entered the current year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The player with the most points by the season's end is the world No. 1 of the year. Players finishing in the top eight of the Emirates ATP Rankings will qualify for the ATP Finals. For current moment, the world No.1 of the year is Novak Djokovic. \n",
